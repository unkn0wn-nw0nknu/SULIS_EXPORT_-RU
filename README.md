/-------*********** MY PROJECTS/TASKS/EXAMS MADE IN SCHOOL ***********-------\

I update here all my stuff made in school. I think it's cool to have it later.

Pictures aren't included (I couldn't upload it due to school blocking some functions), but the most is usable! :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

All credits to me >;-;<

I used my brain, computer, HTML, CSS, JPG, JPEG and PNG files for this project.

I'll update this later on, there's gonna be a lot of other things (yippie.) (._.)

These programs/mark up files aren't my first files/programs ever, they're just made in school.
